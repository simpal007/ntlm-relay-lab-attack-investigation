# ntlm-relay-lab-attack-investigation
This project demonstrates a simulated NTLM Relay attack in a controlled lab environment using Kali Linux and a Windows host system. The goal of this exercise was to understand and analyze how NTLM relay attacks function, how credentials can be captured and relayed, and how such events can be detected through forensic analysis of Windows event logs.
